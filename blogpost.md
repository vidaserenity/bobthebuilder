## Overview 

OVERVIEW OF RESUME BUILDER An online resume builder. It is a webapp developed to simplify the task of creating a resume for individuals, providing effective means of designing a professional looking resume. The webapp is especially designed for individuals who have a hard time creating their resume such as graduate students. This way, they will get a clear idea of the sections and information that should be included in a resume. The system is pretty simple without too much flexibility but can be expanded to include different templates, sections and so on. This project is user-friendly and requires minimum human intervention. Individuals just have to fill up a form that specifies questions from all required fields such as personal questions, educational, experience and skills. The answers provided by the users are stored and the system automatically generates a well structured resume.

OVERVIEW OF RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM The webapp also provides a site to input the preferred job title and location in order to generate the top job postings on [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/). This way, the user can immediately start applying to job right after building their resume. 

The webapp is built on three main components: Indeed Scraper, Flask Webapp and HTML and CSS Files.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
- Programming Language: Python
- User Interface: HTML and CSS

### Component 1: Indeed Scraper 
- 2 paragraphs 
- one code snippet
- one figure

### Component 2: Flask Webapp
- 2 paragraphs 
- one code snippet
- one figure

### Component 3: HTML and CSS file
> HTML <br>
HTML was used in creating the formatting for the website including the following subpages:
- about.html: about us page gives a brief introduction of what the webapp is for
- base.html: specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a document. The <base> tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both. There can only be one single <base> element in a document, and it must be inside the <head> element.
- form.html: contains the code prompting for user input such as personal questions and education. These information will then be stored in different variables to be used in building the resume
- indeed_test.html: prompts for input desired job and location. It will then output the job recommendations generated by the indeed scraper
- main_better.html: represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.
- resume.html: provides a skeleton for our resume pdf. (This is assisted by the style1.css file instead of style.css)
